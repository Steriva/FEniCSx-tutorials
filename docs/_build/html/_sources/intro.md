# Introduction

This book collects some basic theory and tutorials for the Finite Element library [FEniCSx](https://fenicsproject.org).

The book is organised in different chapters, according to the different physical problem analysed. Typically, the weak formulation is derived and the calculations are reported.

Moreover, a detailed analysis of the implementation is presented, along with some installation notes for [FEniCSx](https://fenicsproject.org) using *conda* on a computer (Linux or Mac) or the use in Google Colab {cite}`FEMonColab`.
