# Introduction

This book collects the basic theory and tutorials to use the Incompressible Schrodinger Flow (ISF) algorithm to simulate inviscid fluids with a Finite Element method, by means of the Python library [FEniCSx](https://fenicsproject.org).

The book is organised in two different chapters: at first the basic theory of ISF is presented, then a detailed analysis of the implementation is presented, along with some installation notes for [FEniCSx](https://fenicsproject.org) using *conda* on a computer (Linux or Mac) or the use in Google Colab {cite}`FEMonColab`.
