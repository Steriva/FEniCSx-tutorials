@article{Chorin1968,
 ISSN = {00255718, 10886842},
 abstract = {A finite-difference method for solving the time-dependent Navier Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid is introduced. This method uses the primitive variables, i.e. the velocities and the pressure, and is equally applicable to problems in two and three space dimensions. Test problems are solved, and an application to a three-dimensional convection problem is presented.},
